StateDiagrams
=============
This repository is a collection of all of the analyses performed in the calculation of experimental and simulated data from hair bundles of the inner ear. Included are the MATLAB files allowing one to extract data from a series of .txt outputs from LabVIEW, including the associated metadata. Additionally, Tfind, PSD_plots, hist_plots, and ttraces allows one to calculate the amplitude and frequency of the hair bundle's osccilations, its classification of oscillatory or quiescent, the time window of steady-state behavior, and figures for publication purposes. 

Additional files in the respository are described in the Commit comments. Those without descriptions are commented within the MATLAB file and may or may not be outdated.
